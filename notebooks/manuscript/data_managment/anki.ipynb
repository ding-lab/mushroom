It\\n                    was invented in 1950s, and adopted as a standard in mainland China in 1958. Pinyin is used for\\n                    several purposes such as: teaching Chinese, transcribing names and places into words accessible to\\n                    european language speakers, and used as an input method for typing Chinese characters.</p>\\n                <p>Pinyin is not the only system devised to transcribe Chinese sounds into roman letters. An older\\n                    system called Wade-Giles was used in the first half of the 20th century and it has left its mark on\\n                    the English language. For instance, 功夫 is romanized as \"kungfu\" in Wade-Giles, but \"gongfu\" in\\n                    Pinyin. Also, 北京 (the capital of China) was in the past romanized as \"Peking\", but is \"Beijing\" in\\n                    Pinyin. It is a common misconception that the city changed names, but the sound never changed, only\\n                    how we spell the sound with letters.</p>\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"soundModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"soundModalLabel\">\\n        <div class=\"modal-dialog\" role=\"document\">\\n            <div class=\"modal-content\">\\n                <div class=\"modal-header\">\\n                    <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-label=\"Close\"><span\\n                            aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</span></button>\\n                    <h4 id=\"myModalLabel\" class=\"modal-title\">How to pronounce - <span id=\"finals\"></span></h4>\\n                </div>\\n                <div class=\"modal-body row\" id=\"modal-content\">\\n                    <div class=\"pinyin-video\"></div>\\n                    <div class=\"pinyin-tone\"></div>\\n                    <div class=\"pinyin-explain\"></div>\\n                    <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\t<footer class=\"footer\">\\n        <div class=\"container\">\\n            <div class=\"row\">\\n                <div class=\"col-md-4\">\\n                    <dl>\\n                        <dt>COMPANY</dt>\\n                        <dd><a href=\"/about-us.html\">Our Team</a></dd>\\n                        <dd><a href=\"/contact-us.html\">Contact Us</a></dd>\\n                        <dd><a href=\"/faq.html\">FAQ</a></dd>\\n                        <dd><a href=\"/terms-of-service.html\">Terms of Service</a></dd>\\n                        <dd><a href=\"/privacy-policy.html\">Privacy Policy</a></dd>\\n                    </dl>\\n                </div>\\n                <div class=\"col-md-4\">\\n                    <dl>\\n                        <dt>EXPLORE</dt>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<dd><a href=\"/featured-courses/?utm_source=mainsite\">HSK 1, HSK 2, HSK 3, HSK 4 Courses</a></dd>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<dd><a href=\"/everyday-chinese-101/\">EverydayChinese101 Courses</a></dd>\\n                        <dd><a href=\"/spoken-chinese-course/\">Spoken Chinese Course</a></dd>\\n                        <dd><a href=\"/pricing/\">Pricing</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"/youtube-lessons/\">Youtube Lessons</a></dd>\\n                        <dd><a href=\"/resources/\">Resources</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"/dailymandarin/\">Daily Mandarin</a></dd>\\n                    </dl>\\n                </div>\\n                <div class=\"col-md-4\">\\n                    <h6>FOLLOW US ON</h6>\\n                    <div class=\"site-share\">\\n                        <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/EverydayChinese/\" class=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube</a>\\n                        <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LearnChineseinChinatown/\" class=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>\\n                        <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/EverydayChineseOfficial/\" class=\"instagram\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>\\n                        <a href=\"https://twitter.com/521Chinese\" class=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>\\n                    </div>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n           <div class=\"copyright\">&copy;
